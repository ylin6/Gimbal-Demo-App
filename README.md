# Gimbal-Demo-App
Gimbal Demo App

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the features and functionality of the Gimbal Api. It uses the Gimbal frameworks and API to detect Gimbal BTLE beacons and then display contextual information to the user upon entry or exit of the places. The text on the screen is updated appropriately to reflect when the user is inside or has exited the place representing their beacon.

The app can be simply be run in XCode as long as the proper Gimbal frameworks are included and a valid API key is entered. In order to display any information to the user it requires a working Gimbal beacon that is linked to the developer's Gimbal account through the web portal. 

The documentation used is located at: https://docs.gimbal.com/.

The slides for the presentation can be found in the repo as Bluetooth.pdf.
